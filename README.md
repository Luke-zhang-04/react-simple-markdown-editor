# Simple Markdown Editor

A markdown editor component based off of [satya164/react-simple-code-editor](https://github.com/satya164/react-simple-code-editor)

## Why?
- Other markdown editors don't let you customize highlighting. This takes it to a whole other level and just makes you use another library to highlight
- The code editor does not support features like list bullets on newlines
- Nothing supports BOTH of the above features, which is unfourtunate

# Simple Markdown Editor

A markdown editor component based off of [satya164/react-simple-code-editor](https://github.com/satya164/react-simple-code-editor)

## Why?
- Other markdown editors don't let you customize highlighting. This takes it to a whole other level and just makes you use another library to highlight
- The satya164/react-simple-code-editor is great, but does not support features like list bullets on newlines

- I looked, and nothing supports BOTH of the above features, which is unfourtunate
